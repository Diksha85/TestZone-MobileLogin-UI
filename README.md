# 📱 TestZone - Mobile App Login & Registration UI

Hi there! 👋  
This repository contains a simple but complete **mobile app login and registration flow** that I designed in **Figma** as a practice project to improve my UI/UX design skills.

## ✨ Project Overview

**TestZone** is a fictional mobile app concept.  
This design covers the user flow from opening the app to logging in or registering a new account.

The goal was to create:
- A clean and minimal **splash screen**
- Intuitive **login and sign-up screens**
- Clear **error states** for incorrect inputs
- Consistent spacing, colors, and typography
- A simple prototype flow to demonstrate interactions
